# Cayman Gazette Scraper - Complete Automation

## 🎯 Overview

I've successfully created **2 automated workflows** that handle Cayman Islands gazette scraping using different approaches:

1. **Web Scraping Method** - Uses Firecrawl for advanced web scraping

2. **Replace the mock data** with actual HTML parsing logic
3. **Add PDF processing** if gazettes are in PDF format
4. **The AI analysis is already implemented** using OpenAI

## 🔍 Current Implementation Details

### Smart Gazette Detection
The workflow intelligently determines which gazettes to check:
- **Fridays**: Automatically checks Extraordinary Gazette
- **1st & 15th of month**: Automatically checks Regular Gazette  
- **Other days**: Runs in test mode for manual testing

### Mock Data Structure
The workflow currently uses mock company data that includes:
- Company name
- Type of appointment (Voluntary Liquidation, Receivership, etc.)
- Date of appointment
- Liquidator/receiver name and contact details

### Filtering Logic
- **ONLY** extracts companies under "Voluntary Liquidator and Creditor Notices"
- Excludes all other gazette notices as requested
- **AI-powered validation** ensures data quality and completeness

## 🛠️ Next Steps for Production

### 1. **Real Data Extraction**
```javascript
// Replace mock data with actual HTML parsing
const cheerio = require('cheerio');
const $ = cheerio.load(html);

// Find PDF links or direct text content
$('a[href*=".pdf"]').each((i, element) => {
  // Process each PDF link
});
```

### 2. **PDF Processing**
Add nodes for:
- **HTTP Request** to download PDFs
- **PDF parsing** using libraries like `pdf-parse`
- **Text extraction** from PDF content

### 3. **AI Enhancement** ✅ **ALREADY IMPLEMENTED**
The workflow already includes:
- **OpenAI GPT-4** analysis and validation
- **Smart data quality checks**
- **Trend analysis** and insights
- **Automated validation** of extracted data

### 4. **Data Storage**
Add nodes for:
- **Google Sheets** integration
- **Database storage** (PostgreSQL, MySQL)
- **Email notifications** ✅ **ALREADY IMPLEMENTED**

### 5. **Error Handling**
Add:
- **Try/Catch** blocks in code nodes
- **Error notifications** via email/Slack
- **Retry logic** for failed requests

## 📧 Notification Setup ✅ **ALREADY IMPLEMENTED**

The workflow already includes comprehensive email notifications:

1. **Email Node** ✅ Already configured in the workflow
2. **SMTP Configuration** - Set up in n8n credentials
3. **HTML Email Format** ✅ Already formatted with tables and styling
4. **Email Templates** ✅ Already includes professional HTML template

## 🔐 Security Considerations

- **API Keys**: Store securely in n8n credentials
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect website rate limits
- **User-Agent**: Use appropriate bot identification
- **Error Handling**: Don't expose sensitive data in logs

## 📈 Monitoring

- **Check execution history** in n8n dashboard
- **Monitor error rates** and failed executions
- **Set up alerts** for workflow failures
- **Review extracted data** quality regularly

## 🎉 You're All Set!

# Gazette Scraper — n8n Workflow Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the complete workflow plan for the Cayman Gazette Scraper using n8n. It covers the unified automation, smart scheduling, extraction, AI analysis, multiple output formats, and notification setup.

---

## 1. Unified Workflow Structure

- **Runs**: Every Friday at 9:00 AM (scheduled), and intelligently determines which gazettes to check based on the date.
- **Gazette Types**:
  - **Extraordinary Gazette**: Checked on Fridays
  - **Regular Gazette**: Checked on the 1st and 15th of each month
  - **Test Mode**: All other days, for manual testing
- **Sources**:
  - Extraordinary: https://www.gov.ky/gazettes/extraordinary-gazettes
  - Regular: https://www.gov.ky/gazettes/gazettes

## 2. Workflow Steps & Nodes
The workflow consists of the following main nodes:

### 1. **Schedule Trigger**
```json
{
  "type": "n8n-nodes-base.cron",
  "parameters": {
    "triggerTimes": [
      {
        "mode": "everyWeek",
        "weekDay": "FRI",
        "hour": 9,
        "minute": 0
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### 2. **Determine Gazette Type**
Node: JavaScript (Code)
```javascript
const today = new Date();
const day = today.getDate();
const weekday = today.getDay(); // 0 = Sunday, 5 = Friday
let gazetteType = "Test";
let url = "";
if (weekday === 5) {
  gazetteType = "Extraordinary";
  url = "https://www.gov.ky/gazettes/extraordinary-gazettes";
} else if (day === 1 || day === 15) {
  gazetteType = "Regular";
  url = "https://www.gov.ky/gazettes/gazettes";
}
return [{ gazetteType, url }];
```

### 3. **Fetch Gazette Page**
- Node: HTTP Request
  - Method: GET
  - URL: `{{$json["url"]}}`

### 4. **Extract Company Data**
- Node: Code (JavaScript)
- **Logic**:
  - If HTML, parse the page to extract relevant company notices.
  - If PDF, download and parse PDFs for notices.
  - **Filter:** Only extract companies under “Voluntary Liquidator and Creditor Notices”.

**Example (Mock Data for Demo):**
```javascript
return [
  {
    name: "ABC Holdings Ltd.",
    type: "Voluntary Liquidation",
    appointmentDate: "15th January 2025",
    appointee: "John Smith, Smith & Associates",
    contact: "john.smith@example.com, +1-345-123-4567"
  },
  {
    name: "XYZ Ventures Inc.",
    type: "Voluntary Liquidation",
    appointmentDate: "12th January 2025",
    appointee: "Jane Doe, Liquidators Ltd.",
    contact: "jane.doe@liquidators.ky, +1-345-987-6543"
  }
];
```

### 5. **AI Analysis & Validation**
- Node: OpenAI (GPT-4)
- **Prompt Example**:
```
Analyze the following company liquidation data for completeness and highlight any trends or anomalies. Only consider companies under "Voluntary Liquidator and Creditor Notices".
```

### 6. **Format Final Report**
- Node: Code (JavaScript)
- **Output**: JSON object with metadata, summary, companies array, AI analysis, and extracted fields documentation.

### 7. **Generate Output Formats**
- Node: Code (JavaScript)
- **Produces**:
  - JSON (for API/database)
  - CSV (for spreadsheets)
  - HTML (for email report)

### 8. **Send Email Notification**
- Node: Email Send
  - To: Your chosen email address
  - Subject: Cayman Gazette Liquidations Report
  - Body: HTML formatted report

### 9. **Log Execution**
- Node: Code or Database
- **Logs**: Execution date, gazette type, summary, and status.
