## Key Findings Summary

### Critical Issues (P0 - Fix Immediately)

1. **Node Type Prefix Validation Catastrophe**
   - 5,000+ validation errors from single root cause
   - `nodes-base.X` vs `n8n-nodes-base.X` confusion
   - **Solution**: Auto-normalize prefixes (2-4 hours effort)

2. **TypeError in Node Information Tools**
   - 10-18% failure rate in get_node_essentials/info
   - 1,000+ failures affecting hundreds of users
   - **Solution**: Complete null-safety audit (1 day effort)

3. **Task Discovery Failures**
   - `get_node_for_task` failing 28% of the time
   - Worst-performing tool in entire system
   - **Solution**: Expand task library + fuzzy matching (3 days effort)

### Performance Metrics

**Excellent Reliability (96-100% success):**
- n8n_update_partial_workflow: 98.7%
- search_nodes: 99.8%
- n8n_create_workflow: 96.1%
- All workflow management tools: 100%

**User Distribution:**
- Power Users (12): 2,112 events/user, 33 workflows
- Heavy Users (47): 673 events/user, 18 workflows
- Regular Users (516): 199 events/user, 7 workflows (CORE AUDIENCE)
- Active Users (919): 52 events/user, 2 workflows
- Casual Users (625): 8 events/user, 1 workflow

### Usage Insights

**Most Used Tools:**
1. n8n_update_partial_workflow: 10,177 calls (iterative refinement)
2. search_nodes: 8,839 calls (node discovery)
3. n8n_create_workflow: 6,046 calls (workflow creation)

**Most Common Tool Sequences:**
1. update → update → update (549x) - Iterative refinement pattern
2. create → update (297x) - Create then refine
3. update → get_workflow (265x) - Update then verify

**Most Popular Nodes:**
1. code (53% of workflows) - AI agents love programmatic control
2. httpRequest (47%) - Integration-heavy usage
3. webhook (32%) - Event-driven automation
